# Project Bueno <sub>(temporary name)</sub>

## Bueno's goal is to become what Deno originally was meant to be, a good JS/TS runtime.

This isn't true anymore, Deno supports many features that make it basically what
it originally sweared not to be, e.g.: `npm:`, `node:` specifiers and soon to be
`deno:` specifier, `package.json` support and more.

## Goals in points:

- No node/npm support IN ANY SHAPE OR FORM
- Native support TypeScript/TSX/JSX
- Support as many Web Standard API's as possible
- URL Imports
